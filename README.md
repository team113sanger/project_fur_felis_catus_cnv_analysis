# fur_cnvkit

This repository contains code that was used for performing a copy number alteration (CNA) analysis for the FUR Felis catus project in the Adams group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger institute. It builds on top of [CNVkit](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004873) and can be adapted for other targeted sequencing projects that require a similar analysis by altering the parameters in `src/fur_cnvkit/parameters/parameter_file_template.json`

## Docker Image

This project hosts Docker images on Quay.io. Please see [https://quay.io/repository/team113sanger/fur_cnvkit](https://quay.io/repository/team113sanger/fur_cnvkit?tab=tags).

## Summary

Given
- A cohort of tumor and normal sample `.bam` files and their indexes
- A bedfile describing the targeted regions in a pulldown study
- A reference genome fasta file
- A flat file containing gene coordinates (e.g. Ensembl GTF or GFF3)
- A sample metadata table (Excel/TSV/CSV) containing sample IDs (`Sanger DNA ID` by default), tumour/normal status (`T/N`) and Sex (`Sex`). Column names can be customised via the CNVKit static file CLI or by setting the `metadata_columns` entry in the generated parameter file if your manifests use different headers (for example `Sanger_DNA_ID` or `Phenotype`).


This tool:
- Splits the cohort into male and female sub-cohorts
- Performs `cnvkit assess` and `cnvkit autobin` to determine mappable regions of the genome and split the genome into target and anti-target regions (generating static files).
- Determines which normal samples in each sub-cohort have copy number profiles of sufficient quality to include in a pooled copy number reference by normal vs. normal copy number calling ([Chandramohan et al, 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35487348/)). Samples are evaluated based on the difference between the **median gene-level log2 ratio** in a sample's copy number profile vs the pooled reference of all other samples and the **median of the median gene-level log2 ratios** for all samples in the sub-cohort.
- Creates the pooled copy-number reference file for a sub-cohort from the highest quality normals, discarding the bottom 20% of normal samples.
- Calls copy number alterations in tumour samples against the pooled reference using the `cnvikit batch` sub-command
- Calculates the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the log₂ copy number ratios from segments in each sample, weighted the by average segment size to identify tumours with low-quality, hyper-segmented copy number profiles.
- Removes tumours with low-quality and hypersegmented copy number profiles from each subcohort and optionally generates an oncoprint figure for the remaining samples

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The project's CI/CD pipeline is configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml` and comprises three stages: `build`, `test`, and `publish`.

### Local/Remote Machine Setup

#### Prerequisites:
 - Python 3.10 (or later) installed
 - Poetry installed
    - Follow the [official instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Git + hubflow installed

## Running Tests

This project uses pytest as the main testing framework and all tests are located in the `tests` directory. For formatting and linting, we use `pre-commit` hooks which are installed in the setup steps above.

### Unit & Integration Tests

Before running the tests, ensure that your virtual environment is activated and all the required packages are installed. If you followed the above setup steps, your environment should be ready.

To run the tests, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
# To run all tests
pytest
# If you want to see a more verbose output
pytest -sv
# If you want to have the tests stop after the second failure
pytest --maxfail 2
# If you want to run only the failing tests from the last run
pytest --lf
```

### Pre-commit (Linting & Formatting)

This project uses `pre-commit` hooks to ensure that all code is formatted and linted before committing. That means whenever you commit the code will be checked and then check again on the remote GitLab server. If the code is not formatted or linted, the commit will fail.

To run the hooks manually, execute the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
# Or use the CICD compatible script
./cicd_scripts/format_test.sh
```

## Rolling out a Tagged Release
This repo the GitFlow branching model and uses [hubflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/TheHubFlowTools.html) as a tool to enable this from the CLI.

```bash
# Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Start a new release branch e.g. 0.1.0 not v0.1.0
git hf release start <project_version>
```

Now, do the following things:
* `CHANGELOG.md`: Under the heading of the newest release version, describe what was changed, fixed, added.
* `pyproject.toml`: Increment the project version to the current release version
* Commit these changes

Finally

```bash
git hf release finish <project_version>
```
